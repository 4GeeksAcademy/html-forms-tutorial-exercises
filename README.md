Forms are so important in the world of HTML, CSS and Javascript that I decided to give them a special course to focus in all the inputs, buttons and elements that HTML brings by default to focus on interaction. During these exercises you will learn the following:

1. How to use text inputs, text areas, date inputs and numeric inputs.

2. How to use dropdowns.

3. How to form preventive validations.

4. The difference between GET and POST.

5. Styling a form.

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/html-forms-tutorial-exercises) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-forms-tutorial-exercises.git).

> Once you have VSCode open the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local installation

Clone the repository in your local environment and follow the steps below:

1. Install LearnPack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the HTML compiler plugin for LearnPack, make sure you also have node.js 14+:

```bash
$ npm i @learnpack/learnpack -g
```

2. Download these particular exercises using LearnPack and `cd` into the folder:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-forms-tutorial-exercises
$ cd html-forms-tutorial-exercises
```

> Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find an "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```bash
$ learnpack start
```
<!-- endhide -->

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small React application containing the following files:

1. **index.html:** represents the entry file for the entire exercise.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading, but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion, or you may get frustrated.
