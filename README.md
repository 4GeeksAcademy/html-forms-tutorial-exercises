Forms are so important in the world of HTML, CSS and Javascript that I decided to give them a special course to focus in all the inputs, buttons and elements that HTML brings by default to focus on interaction. During these exercises you will learn:

1. Using text inputs, text areas, date inputs and numeric inputs.

2. Using dropdowns.

3. Form preventive validations.

4. GET vs POST.

5. Styling a form

## One click installation:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-forms-tutorial-exercises.git)

## Local installation

1. Install learnpack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the html compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 14+:

```
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-html
```

2. Download this particular exercises using learnpack and `cd` into the folder:

```
$ learnpack download html-forms-tutorial-exercises
$ cd html-forms-tutorial-exercises
```

Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find a "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level were your bc.json file is:

```sh
$ npm i jest@24.8.0 -g
$ learnpack start
```

Note: The exercises have automatic grading but its very rigid and string, my recomendation is to ignore the tests and use them only as a recomendation or you can get frustrated.

## How are the React Tutorial Exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **index.js:** represents the entry file for the entire exercise.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
