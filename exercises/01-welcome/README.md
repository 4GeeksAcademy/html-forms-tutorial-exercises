# `01` Welcome to the world of HTML 😆 !!

Hello, my name is [Alejandro Sanchez](http://alesanchezr.com) and I'm one of the founders of @4GeeksAcademy (coding bootcamp).

These exercises and many other interactive tutorials have been open sourced and released to the public for free thru the [BreatheCode Website](www.BreatheCo.de).

These exercises are for anyone interested in mastering HTML Forms, we will go over the following concepts:

1. Using inputs

2. Form preventive validations

3. GET vs POST

4. Styling a form

## ➡️ Incremental & Autograded

- I've built the exercises incrementally, so you should feel the progress little by little, and hopefully, the difficulty raising between exercises will never be too big to get you frustrated.

- All exercises have been automatically graded thanks to [@username](https://github.com/haydavid23)
