## 📝 Instructions

Replace all the .class and #id selectors from index.css and replace them with other types of selectors to accomplish the same reference. For example:

```html
<div><a class="myAnchor">Here is an anchor</a></div>

```css
<style>
.myAnchor{ background: red; }
</style>

```css
<style>
a{ background:red;}
</style>
```
